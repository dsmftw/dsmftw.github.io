    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My name is Igor Kozlov. I am a full-stack software developer and a recent <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href='https://www.sfu.ca/'>SFU</a> grad, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href='https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html'>Computing Science Major</a>.</p>
    <p>I enjoy writing and experimenting with code, working with databases, and building back-ends.
    While I am not working/studying I like to spend time customizing my Gentoo Linux machine, getting involved with amature astronomy, playing soccer and hockey, snowboarding, and hiking the countless trails in my home province, Beautiful British Columbia.</p>
    <p>Oh, and I also build a daily-driven race/drag car as a &quot;side project&quot; ;)</p>
